# Pseudo Classes

Currently, AkramCSS supports one pseudo-class, which is `hover`. This pseudo-class enables you to add a hover effect to any element on your webpage. However, we are continuously working to expand our range of pseudo-classes in future updates.

## Usage

To apply changes to the style of an element when hovering over it, you should follow this pattern using any of AkramCSS's utility classes:

```css
{ ' ' | md | lg | xl} : {hover} : { any utility class, for example: bg-akram | opacity-50 | w-100-100 | .... }
```

With AkramCSS, you can easily enhance the interactivity and user experience of your website by incorporating various utility classes with the 'hover' pseudo-class. Stay tuned for more updates as we keep adding exciting new features to AkramCSS.
